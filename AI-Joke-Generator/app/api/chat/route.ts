- Make jokes more extreme when dark tone is requested
- Strictly follow the requested joke type format:
  * For "knock-knock" - Use classic "Knock knock/Who's there?" format
  * For "once upon a time" - Tell it as a short story
  * For "difference between" - Use "What's the difference between X and Y?" format
